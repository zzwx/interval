Utility for normalizing a numeric range, with a wrapping function useful for polar coordinates.

It is a **golang clone** of a JavaScript project by [James Talmage](https://github.com/jamestalmage/normalize-range).

For dealing with the strict typing in Go, functions were simply auto-generated functions for all of the following types:

* `int`
* `int64`
* `int32`
* `int16`
* `int8`
* `uint`
* `uint64`
* `uint32`
* `uint16`
* `uint8`
* `float32`
* `float64`

## Motivation

I did not investigate whether generating all the variations is the best way or not to deal with all the numeric types. Making functions accept `interface{}` didn't sound like a robust approach. Certainly if only a subset of these auto-generated functions is used, the Go compiler is not going to include them all in the final build. This approach is inspired by [Rob Pike's article](https://blog.golang.org/generate) on code generation. In a meanwhile I found out that Generics may not be an overall remedy, especially where the code should be written differently depending on the actual numeric capacity. I ended up writing a universal code though.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/zzwx/interval
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/zzwx/interval"
)

func main() {
  interval.WrapInt(0, 360, 400) //=> 40
  interval.WrapInt(0, 360, -90) //=> 270
  interval.LimitInt(0, 100, 500) //=> 100
  interval.LimitInt(0, 100, -20) //=> 0
}
```
